    {
      "text": "Why does the dose rate from a point source fall as 1/r²?",
      "options": [
        "Because of friction",
        "Because the surface area grows as r²",
        "Because it's customary"
      ],
      "answer": "Because the surface area grows as r²",
      "explain": "Flux spreads over the sphere 4πr², hence the 1/r² dependence."

      "text": "Which formula does the simulator use for attenuation?",
      "options": [
        "D = k·r²",
        "D = k·exp(+Σμx)",
        "D = k·exp(−Σμx)/r²"

      "answer": "D = k·exp(−Σμx)/r²",
      "explain": "Exponential attenuation and geometric decrease with distance."

      "text": "Which material is educationally more effective for beta component?",
      "options": [
        "Lead",
        "Acrylic/glass",
        "Steel"
      ],
      "answer": "Acrylic/glass",
      "explain": "For beta, low‑Z materials are preferred; lead may increase bremsstrahlung."

    {
      "text": "Why do we introduce the D_safe threshold?",
      "options": [
        "For aesthetics",
        "To classify zones and make decisions",
        "To hide model errors"
      ],
      "answer": "To classify zones and make decisions",
      "explain": "The threshold visualizes 'conditionally safe' vs 'needs action'."

      "text": "What happens to D(r) if any screen is thickened by Δx with others fixed?",
      "options": [
        "It increases",
        "It does not change",
        "It decreases"
      ],
      "answer": "It decreases",
      "explain": "exp(−μ (x+Δx)) < exp(−μ x)."

      "text": "Why doesn't the order of layers matter in our model?",
      "options": [
        "Because μ=0",
        "Σμx is commutative in the exponent",
        "Order is always crucial"
